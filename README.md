1. To get the code running, type:
   SET DEBUG=express-app:*

   npm start

   And then find the web page on http://127.0.0.1:3000/. (This method seems to give an error currently.)

2. We all worked on various aspects of the project. Corina and Matt worked to create the html for the locations in our app as well as find pictures and give each the appropriate data. Corina was in charge of creating the github and giving us a space to cooperate, while Matt helped additionally by fixing small formatting mistakes and suggesting ways to make the app more usable. Mike worked on the homepage, endpage, about, contact, faq, and contact html files and the style sheet. In the style sheet Mike added some aspects of responsive design, child manipulation, formatting and general styling.
